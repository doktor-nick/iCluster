Installing the source code
--------------------------
 To run and modify the source code, you need to install the
beautiful proce55ing programming language. It can be found at:

 http://processing.org

Proce55ing is available for linux/windows/macosx. It is very well
documented, easy to learn if you've programmed in a high level
language such as C or java, and has several good books available.

iCluster is currently developed under proce55ing version 2.2.1 under linux,
but is tested on all 3 platforms. Hence the preferred OS is linux, but
the other OS's should work fine.

WARNING: iCluster has not yet been updated to work with Processsing 3

As with the stand alone iCluster application, a computer with a good
dedicated graphics card is recommended.

To install and run iCluster:
1. First install proce55ing. Run the proce55ing executable and run some
   of the Examples under the File menu to make sure all is well.
2. Processing has a default 'Sketchbook' location which is a folder
   that contains your programs. This varies between operating systems,
   but selecting File/Preferences will show where it is.
3. Close the proce55ing application.
4. Copy the iCluster folder, ie iClusterRelease106, from the src directory
   that you're reading this file in into the Sketchbook folder.
5. Restart proce55ing. Under the File/Sketchbook menu you should now
   see iCluster106ReleaseBeta. Select this menu item and the source code
   will come up in a new editor window.
6. Press the play button in that editor window to run iCluster.

If you find iCluster useful in your work please reference:

Note: the iCluster source code is released under the GPL v3 license,
a copy of which is included within the distribution. Any bad stuff
that happens as a result of using iCluster is your own fault for
being fool enough to install it in the first place.
